    <h1>in this react series i got the idea of how to run a program and manupilate it by use of  vite (syntax :  npm create vite@latest )
      by giving command to terminal i.e
      1) create a vite project with  'npm create vite@latest'
      2) manipulate the files as per desire by deleting and adding content
      3)the last thing we have done is run the  'scripts' from package.json file i.e
      npm run dev
      npm run built
      npm run lint
      npm run preview

      those are the commands to run in terminal .

thank you
